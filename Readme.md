The voting system for deciding where to have lunch

Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC/SpringSecurity with simple frontend.

The task is:

Build a voting system for deciding where to have lunch.<br>
•2 types of users: admin and regular users <br>
•Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day 
(2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)<br>
•Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)<br>
•Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at<br>
•Only one vote counted per user<br>
•If user votes again the same day: ◦If it is before 11:00 we asume that he changed his mind.<br>
◦If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed<br>

Each restaurant provides new menu each day.
